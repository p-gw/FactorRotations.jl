[FactorRotations.jl](https://github.com/p-gw/FactorRotations.jl) implements factor rotations by the gradient projections algorithms described
in Bernaards & Jennrich (2005).

## Installation
To install FactorRotations.jl you can use the Julia package manager,

```julia
] add https://github.com/p-gw/FactorRotations.jl.git
```

## Getting started
FactorRotations.jl provides methods to rotate factor loading matrices, e.g. from 
exploratory factor analysis or principle component analysis.

Assume you aquired a factor loading matrix `L` then you can rotate the matrix by calling
the `rotate` function. The `rotate` function takes the factor loading matrix as the first
argument and an instance of a rotation method as the second argument.

```julia
L = [
    0.830 -0.396
    0.818 -0.469
    0.777 -0.470
    0.798 -0.401
    0.786  0.500
    0.672  0.458
    0.594  0.444
    0.647  0.333
]

rotate(L, Varimax())
```

For a complete list of available methods see the [Rotation Methods](https://github.com/p-gw/FactorRotations.jl/rotation_methods.jl) section of the documentation.
